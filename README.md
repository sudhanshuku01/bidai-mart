ðŸŒŸ Core Concept of BID.ai:

Sellers list products on the platform.
Buyers visit these product pages, generating view counts.
Sellers get free visibility up to a certain limit (100 views per product).
Once a product reaches 100 views, the seller must pay to keep receiving views.
BID Packages (BID @49, BID @99) allow sellers to purchase extra views.
Admins track listings, purchases, and high-performing sellers to optimize pricing.


ðŸ“Œ Key Features of BID.ai (Based on the Assignment)
Marketplace for sellers to list products.
Buyers can browse and view products.
A system tracks product views in real time.
A paywall activates after 100 views, requiring sellers to buy more visibility.
Payments are processed via Razorpay/Stripe.
An admin dashboard monitors seller activity and revenue.
ðŸ”¹ In short: BID.ai is a pay-for-visibility marketplace where sellers can boost their product exposure by purchasing BID Packages after their free limit is exhausted.
